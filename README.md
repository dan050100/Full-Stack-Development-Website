# Full-Stack-Development-Website

This is a piece of coursework for my Second Year Internet Applications Module. 

The coursework was based around a Lost and found items idea. A user can view all of the lost items that are in the database as well as request their items back or upload a new item which they have found. If they send a request for their lost item back, the administrator has the option whether to accept or decline the user's request.  HTML, CSS and Bootstrap4 were all used for the front end development, whilst MySQL, PHP and Apache were used for the backend programming. XAMPP was the package I used to implement this project. Security features such as prevention of SQL and HTML injection were removed and prevention of duplicate accounts being made. Other features which were not specified in the brief include emails being sent to user's accounts if their item/s had been found. 

Final Grade: 100%
